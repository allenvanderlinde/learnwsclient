Learnwsclient is a .NET command-line tool used to pull user, course, and enrollment data from a Blackboard Learn environment using Blackboard's SOAP web services. Learnwsclient is currently single-threaded but supports batch requests by pulling data on multiple entries stored in a file. Requested data can be exported to file by specifying a file name. Default export format is Snapshot FlatFile but data can be exported to a comma-separated values file as well.
