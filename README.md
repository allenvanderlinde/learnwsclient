# learnwsclient

Learnwsclient is a .NET, command-line web services client for Blackboard, Inc's Learning Management System, Learn(tm). It utilizes the raw algorithms found in the project [wsclient](https://github.com/allenvanderlinde/wsclient) and offers powerful look-up features similar to a database for users, courses, and enrollments.

Some features are:

* Customizable proxy tool registration with full entitlements
* Returns request data in Snapshot FlatFile format ready for modification and integration
* Exports into Flatfile format (.txt) or Comma-separated values format (.csv)

If you use the release version executable, there is something similar to a man page accessed by entering just "learnwsclient" in the command line.
